STUDY SETUP

  * user to manually create study meta data files (see docs for details/instructions)
      - [StudyName]_Patients.xlsx
      - [StudyName]_Samples.xlsx
      - [StudyName]_FOVs.xlsx
      - [StudyName]_Markers.xlsx
      - [StudyName]_CellTypes.xlsx
      - [StudyName]_Questions.xlsx
      - [StudyName]_CellStates.xlsx

  * user to configure study
      - start with config template(s)
      - at minimum, manually change:
          - halo_image_dir
          - halo_boundaries_dir
          - halo_csv_dir
          - meta_dir

       * NOTE: halo boundary XML files and halo CSV files MUST follow a consistent format, including the CellDive_ID as it appears in meta files

      - run config script to set up project directory structure including links to input files
      - validate meta files & cross check data files
      - generate cell state index file by mapping fraction & density conditions to each other, sorting according to configuration file and assigning a `Cell State ID` to each state




PIPELINE STEPS

  * preprocessing
      - parse, validate and save study meta data files and save in single RDA file
      - convert Halo CSV files to RDA
      - convert Halo XML files to RDA (nested lists)
      - analyze Halo image files & create drift/loss text files
      - mark exclusions, create [CellDive_ID]_EXCL.rda files for each sample
      - normalize/rethreshold data and save to [CellDive_ID]_RETHRESHOLDED.rda 
  
  * clustering? 

  * neighborhoods
      - create RDA file for each cell subtype?

  * annotate cells
      - convert normalized/rethresholded data for each sample from cell+marker level to cell level, creating a column for all positive markers in a cell and one for all positive cell identity markers in a cell
      - assign to each cell all classifiers whose definitions fit its combination of positive and negative markers (defined in *_CellTypes.xlsx meta file)
      - save to rda file named [CellDive_ID]_annotated_cells.rda

  * calculate metrics
      - count all existing cell type combinations, summarize in several different ways and save all to XLSX file
      - count number of cells in each cell state in each sample/FOV
      - count number of cells in each cell state in each 10um band around tumor interface in each sample/FOV
      - calculate total area of each FOV
      - calculate total area of each 10um infiltration band in each sample/FOV
      - calculate fractions of each cell state out of populations outlined in cell state index in each sample/FOV
      - calculate fractions of each cell state out of populations outlined in cell state index in each Band in each sample/FOV
      - calculate total density of each cell state in each sample/FOV
      - calculate total density of each Band in each sample/FOV
      - calculate neighborhood average counts in each sample/FOV
      - calculate neighborhood average counts in each band in each sample/FOV
      - calculate neighborhood fractions in each sample/FOV
      - calculate neighborhood fractions in each band in each sample/FOV

  * statistics
      - create XLSX file showing which samples are included in each sample (see docs for details)
      - for each question:
         - separate samples into two groups according to criteria outlined in [StudyName]_Questions.xlsx
             - for each group, calculate median fraction/density/average of all cell states in each FOV
         - for fraction conditions, run wilcox test to get log(Odds Ratio), pval, FDR & CI 
         - for density conditions, run wilcox test to get log(Fold Change), pval, FDR & CI



  * plots & figures
      - boxplots
          - fraction CD25+ cells in each cell subtype (all Treated vs. Untreated samples (question 3a?))
          - fraction each cell subtype out of all immune cells (all Treated vs Untreated samples (question 3a?))
      - infiltration density bar plots
          - see density config YAML file
      - CD25 heatmaps?
      - stats overview plots (all cell states)
      - stats detail plots (subset of conditions)
      - neighborhood pos/neg bubble chart(s)
      - tSNE plots
